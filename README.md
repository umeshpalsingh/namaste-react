# Introducing React.

Q ) What is React? Why React is known as ‘React’?

React is a JavaScript Library. The name ‘React’ was chosen
because the library was designed to allow developers to react
to changes in state and data within an application, and to
update the user interface in a declarative and efficient
manner.

Q ) What is Library?

Library is a collections of prewritten code snippets that can
be used and reused to perform certain tasks. A particular
JavaScript library code can be plugged into application code
which leads to faster development and fewer vulnerabilities to
have errors.
Examples: React, jQuery

Q ) What is Framework?

Framework provides a basic foundation or structure for a
website or an application.

Q ) Similarities between Library and Framework?

Frameworks and libraries are code written by third parties to
solve regular/common problems or to optimise performance.

Q ) Difference between Library and Framework?

A key difference between the two is Inversion of control. When
using a library, the control remains with the developer who
tells the application when to call library functions. When
using a framework, the control is reversed, which means that
the framework tells the developer where code needs to be
provided and calls it as it requires.
